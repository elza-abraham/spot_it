Spot it!, a.k.a. Dobble, is a simple pattern recognition game in which players try to find an image shown on two cards. Each
card in original Spot it! features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next. Any
two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the
symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever
has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins!
